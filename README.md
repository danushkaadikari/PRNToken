## The Concept

Digitized Estates leverage blockchain technology and smart contracts to enable fractional ownership of real estate assets through digital NFT tokens.

These NFT tokens represent shares in the property's value and potential income.

By tokenizing real estate, Digitized Estates aims to democratize access to real estate investments, eliminate geographical barriers, and provide greater liquidity.
